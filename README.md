# Practice Session Timer
Helps users know how far along they should be during sessions

Features:
- Always-on-top.
- Slim and narrow so it takes up the least amount of screen space.
- Displays what question you *should* be on for the current block/session, based on the alloted time and number of questions.
- Otherwise, pictures speak a thousand words.
